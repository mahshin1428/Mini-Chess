#MiniChess
MiniChess is a simplified chess game where a human player competes against an AI opponent powered by Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms. 
This project is a great demonstration of artificial intelligence concepts applied to classic board game logic.

ðŸ“Œ Features
-->Simplified chess engine with customizable board size (e.g. 5x6 --> named Speed Chess)

--> Human vs AI gameplay via terminal or GUI (coming soon)

--> AI decision-making using Minimax algorithm

--> Performance-optimized using Alpha-Beta Pruning

--> Move validation, game state evaluation, and basic checkmate detection




@Algorithms used

Minimax: A decision rule for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization for the Minimax algorithm that significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
